# Gender swap filter
The title is self explanatory.

## Roadmap
1. Face landmark detection
2. Male/female detection
3. Male/female filter/diffusion model? 
4. Application and drawing the filter on top

## Dev notes
* I am going to have to rotate an image in 3d space.
* I also have no idea how to do a wraparound crown.
* From what I'm reading the rotation is done by anchoring certain points and getting the rotated points of the face (constants)
* Something called procrustes projection alignment
* Calculate the face's distances and landmarks and etc
* Get image parameters from the name (landmarks, direction, etc) and pass it through the add_filter function later
