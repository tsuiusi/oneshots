# Papers
My implementations of the seminal papers of machine learning.

Inspired (to start) by https://github.com/hitorilabs/papers.

Will work through this while going through PRML.

This repo also serves as a devlog and notes.

**Table of Contents:**
1. [Initialization](#initialization) 
2. [ResNet](#resnet)
3. [Random Forest](#random-forest)
4. [Perceptron](#perceptron)

## Initialization
'''
pip install numpy mlx torch pandas matplotlib-pyplot 
'''


## ResNet
* Residual network
* Very vertical

devlog:
* the typing is wrong (loss function -> call -> input x is wrong type/format, check gpt chatlog)
* data is loading which is good
* I'm completely fried
